  "name": "Odd and multiples of 3",
  "instruction": "Write a function `isOddAndMultipleOfThree` that takes a number and returns true if the number is odd and a multiple of 3. Otherwise it returns false.\n\nThis problem can be solved with `if`, but try solving it with `&amp;&amp;` to practice.\n\nA similar example:\n```javascript\nfunction isEvenAndMultipleOfFour(number) {\n  if (number % 2 === 0 && number % 4 === 0) {\n    return true;\n  }\n  return false;\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the input is a number that is checked for parity and a multiple of 4. If the number is even and divisible by 4, the function returns true, otherwise false.\n\nThe multiplicity can be checked using the `%` operator. It returns the remainder of the division. For example, `5 % 2' equals 1, because 5 divides by 2 with a remainder of 1. And `4 % 2' equals 0, because 4 is divisible by 2 without a remainder.\n\nA multiple of 3 means that the remainder of division by 3 is 0. For example, `9 % 3' equals 0, because 9 is divisible by 3 without a remainder.\n\n\nThe logical AND (`&&`) returns true if both operands are true. Otherwise it returns false. For example, ` 2 > 1 && 3 > 2` is true because both operands are true. But `2 > 1 && 3 < 2` is false because one of the operands is false."
