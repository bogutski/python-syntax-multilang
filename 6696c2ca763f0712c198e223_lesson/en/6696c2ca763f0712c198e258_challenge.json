  "name": "Determine that 4 points form a square",
  "instruction": "In this problem we will use coordinate axes.\n\nThe `x` axis points to the right, the `y` axis points upward.\n\nThe point `(0, 0)` is the origin of the coordinates.\n\nIt is in this problem that we do not use negative coordinates.\n\nAll points are in the first quarter of the coordinate plane.\n\nWrite a function `isSquare` that takes four points and returns `true` if these points form a square.\n\nEach point is given by two coordinates: `x` and `y`.\n\nA square is a quadrilateral with all sides equal.\n\nThe function `isSquare` takes parameters in the following order:\n- `x1`, `y1` - coordinates of the first point. The bottom left point of the square.\n- `x2`, `y2` - coordinates of the second point. The upper left point of the square.\n- `x3`, `y3` - coordinates of the third point. The upper right point of the square.\n- `x4`, `y4` - coordinates of the fourth point. The bottom right point of the square.\n\nA total of 4 points and 8 parameters. The sequence of definition of points is important.\n\nThe bottom edge of the square is parallel to the `x` axis, the left edge is parallel to the `y` axis.\n\nExamples of running a function:\n```javascript.\nisSquare(2, 1, 2, 2, 5, 6, 5, 6, 1); // true\nisSquare(2, 1, 2, 5, 8, 5, 8, 1) // false\n```\n\nFor a better understanding, draw these shapes on paper. Find patterns in the coordinates of the points.\n\n![](https://course-qa-basics.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/square-diagram.gif)\n\nYou will probably notice that the points in the square have common properties between the pairs.\n\nFor example, `x1` and `x2` are always equal, and `y1` and `y4` are always equal. Find the rest of the patterns.\n\nNote that simply comparing all parameters with each other will not work, because in some cases it will miss the rectangle.\n\nBe sure to do a check for the length of the sides of the square - the horizontal and vertical sides must be equal.\n\nUse `if` and comparison operators to solve the problem.\n\n\nChecking algorithm:\n1. Check that `x1` is equal to `x2`.\n2. Check that `y1` equals `y4`.\n3. Check that `x3` is equal to `x4`.\n4. Check that `y2` is equal to `y3`.\n5. Check that `(y2-y1)` equals `(x3 - x2)` - the lengths of the perpendicular sides are equal.\n\nIf all conditions are satisfied, the points form a square.",
