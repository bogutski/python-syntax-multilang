  "instruction": "Write a function `isEvenFromThree` that takes three numbers `n1`, `n2`, `n3` and returns `true` if there is at least one even number among them, and `false` if not.\n\nAn even number is a number that is divisible by 2 without a remainder.\n\nExamples of triggers:\n``javascript\nisEvenFromThree(1, 2, 3); // true\nisEvenFromThree(1, 3, 5); // false\nisEvenFromThree(2, 4, 6); // true\nisEvenFromThree(1, 3, 7); // false\n```"
