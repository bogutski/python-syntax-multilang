  "instruction": "Write a function `isDuplicate` that takes two objects and returns `true` if at least two properties match, otherwise `false`.\n\nThe function takes two objects that may have the following properties:\n* `firstName` - user's first name, string\n* `lastName` - user's last name, string\n* `city` - user's city, string\n* `phone` - user's phone number, string\n\nAll properties may contain leading and trailing spaces, as well as different letter cases.\n\nThe phone number may have leading and trailing spaces, and may start with or without a `+` sign.\n\nPhone numbers with and without a `+` sign are considered the same.\n\nThe task is to check if the property values match, ignoring spaces and letter cases.\n\nIf at least two properties match, the function should return `true`, otherwise `false`.\n\nExample function calls:\n```javascript\nisDuplicate({\n  firstName: ' JohN ',\n  lastName: '  Doe',\n  phone: '+4234567890',\n  city: 'Miami'\n}, {\n  firstName: '  john  ',\n  lastName: ' D',\n  phone: ' 4234567890   ',\n  city: '  Florida '\n}) // true because firstName and phone match\n\nisDuplicate({\n  firstName: ' J ',\n  lastName: '  Doe',\n  phone: '+4234567890',\n  city: 'Miami'\n}, {\n  firstName: '  john  ',\n  lastName: ' D',\n  phone: ' 4234567890   ',\n  city: '  Florida '\n}) // false because only one property matches - phone\n\nisDuplicate({\n  firstName: ' J ',\n  lastName: '  Doe',\n  phone: '+4234567890',\n  city: '  MIAMi'\n}, {\n  firstName: '  john  ',\n  lastName: ' D',\n  phone: ' 4234567890   ',\n  city: '  miami '\n}) // true because two properties match - city and phone\n```\n\nThe combinations of properties can be different, but at least two properties must match.\n\nThe variable `count` will help you in solving the task, which will store the number of property matches.\n\nOnce a match is found, increase `count` by 1.\n\nAfter iterating through all properties, check if `count` is greater than or equal to 2.",
