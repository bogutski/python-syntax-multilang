  "instruction": "To participate in the event, users must fill out an application.\n\nEach completed application is an object with user information.\n\nAfter submitting the application, the system will compare it with each of the previously submitted applications.\n\nIf this application has already been submitted before, the resubmission will be considered a duplicate.\n\nWe will only create a mechanism to compare one application with another.\n\nWhen users submit an application, they fill in the following fields:\n* `firstName` - user's first name, string\n* `lastName` - user's last name, string\n* `phone` - user's phone number, string\n* `city` - user's city, string\n\nWrite a function `isDuplicate`.\n\nFunction parameters:\n* `profileSaved` - object with information about the user who has already submitted an application.\n* `profileNew` - object with information about the user who is about to submit an application.\n\nThe function should return `true` if the applications match, and `false` if they don't.\n\nIn the submitted and new applications, users can perform the following actions:\n* There may be spaces at the beginning and end of the first and last names.\n* The first and last names may have different letter cases.\n* There may be spaces at the beginning and end of the phone number.\n* The phone number may start with `+` or without it.\n\nPhone numbers with and without `+` are considered the same.\n\nFunction call example:\n```javascript\nisDuplicate({\n  firstName: ' JohN ',\n  lastName: '  Doe',\n  phone: '+4234567890',\n  city: 'Miami'\n}, {\n  firstName: '  john  ',\n  lastName: ' DOE',\n  phone: ' 4234567890   ',\n  city: '  MIAMI '\n}) // true\n```\n\nIn this example, the applications match because the users are the same regardless of different letter cases, spaces, and `+` in the phone number.",
