### String. A string is text

A string can consist of any characters (letters, numbers, spaces, symbols) enclosed in quotation marks `` " ", ' ', \`\` ``

```javascript
console.log('Hello'); // Hello is text / string / String.
console.log('123 + 234'); // the console will print 123 + 234, single quotes
console.log("123 + 234"); // console will print 123 + 234, double quotes
console.log(`123 + 234`); // console will print 123 + 234, reversed quotes
```

Quotes of the same type must always open at the beginning of the line and close at the end of the line.

```javascript
console.log('123 + 234); // this is ERROR, no quotation marks at the end of the line
```

You can perform text operations with strings.

#### A few examples of text operations

* String concatenation
* Change the case of the string - capital letters, small letters
* Combining and splitting lines
* Character Substitution
* Search
* Entry check

### Number

```javascript
console.log(123); // console will print 123, Number
console.log(123 + 124); // console will print 247, Mathematical expression, Number
```

#### Some examples of operations with numbers

* math plus `+`
* minus `-`
* multiply `*`
* divide `/`
* Extract the remainder of the division of `%`
* Increase to the power of `**`
* Extract the square root - multiplication of `0.5`, i.e. `** 0.5`. 


Comment: The semicolon in JavaScript is optional unless you use several instructions
in one line.
