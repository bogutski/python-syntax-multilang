  "name": "Array of squares",
  "instruction": "The function `powerOfTwo` takes an array of positive numbers greater than 0.\n\nYou need to return a new array with only those numbers that are squares of other numbers.\n\nFor example, 4 is the square of number 2, 9 is the square of number 3, etc.\n\nTo determine if a number is the square of some other number, you must take the square root of that number and check if the result is an integer.\n\nAn example of running a function:\n```javascript\npowerOfTwo([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) // [1, 4, 9]\npowerOfTwo([1, 3, 9, 27]) // [1, 9]\n```"
