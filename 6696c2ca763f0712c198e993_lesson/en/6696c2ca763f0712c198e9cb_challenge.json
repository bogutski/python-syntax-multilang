  "name": "Output phone numbers from the array",
  "instruction": "Phone numbers contain 10 digits. Write a function `onlyPhoneNumbers` that takes an array of strings as a parameter.\n\nThe function should return a new array containing only phone numbers.\n\nStrings such as birthdates, which are also 10 characters, can come as elements of the array,\nbut are not phone numbers. They contain dots in the string. They do not need to be counted.\n\nIf a string consists of two words (and the length of this string is also 10), then such a string is not a phone number.\n\nExample of function launch:\n```javascript\nonlyPhoneNumbers(['1234567890', '123456789', '12345678901']); // ['1234567890']\nonlyPhoneNumbers(['1234567890', '14.04.1980', 'Address is', '1234567890']); // ['1234567890', '1234567890']\n```"
