It is denoted by the lowercase Latin letter \"e\".\nThe number is approximately equal to 2.7.\n\nCreate a constant named `e` and assign it the value `2.7`. Use the keyword `const`.\n\nHere is an example that is fundamentally similar to what you need to do,\nbut adapt it to the requirements of the task:\n```javascript\nconst a = 3.8;\n```",
