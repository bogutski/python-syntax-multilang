  "name": "Is the pizza salesman telling the truth?",
  "instruction": "The pizza salesman says that a large pizza is more profitable than a small one in terms of price to size ratio.\n\nLet's check this statement with different diameters and prices.\n\nThe function `pizzaCompare` receives parameters:\n\n* `smallDiameter` - diameter of a small pizza,\n* `bigDiameter` - diameter of a large pizza,\n* `smallPrice` - price of a small pizza,\n* `bigPrice` - price of a large pizza.\n\nIf the large pizza is really more profitable, the function should return `true`, otherwise `false`.\n\nSolution algorithm:\n* 1. Find the area of the small pizza.\n* 2. Find the area of the large pizza\n* 3. find the price per square centimeter of a small pizza\n* 4. find the price per square centimeter of a large pizza\n* 5. compare prices per square centimeter\n* 6. Return the result of the comparison\n\nThe area of a circle is equal to `3.14 * radius ** 2'.\n\nHave you noticed that the `pizzaCompare` function has repetitive code? Try putting it in a separate function `getCircleArea` and calling it inside `pizzaCompare`.\n\nCreate a function `getCircleArea` that takes a single parameter `diameter` and returns the area of the circle. Use this function inside `pizzaCompare`.\n\nThe `getCircleArea` function must be declared next to the `pizzaCompare` function, but not inside it. The function `pizzaCompare` must call the function `getCircleArea` inside itself.\n\nAn example of two functions:\n```javascript\nfunction getRoomArea(width, length) {\n  return width * length;\n}\n\nfunction twoRoomsAreaCompare(width1, length1, width2, length2) {\n  const area1 = getRoomArea(width1, length1);\n  const area2 = getRoomArea(width2, length2);\n  return area1 > area2;\n}\n```"
