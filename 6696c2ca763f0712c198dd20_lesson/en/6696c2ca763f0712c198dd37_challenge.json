And if you add something to emptiness, you will get what you added...\" (from \"Tales about numbers\")\n\nCreate a variable named `empty` and assign it the value `null`.\nCreate a variable named `number` and assign it a random number.\nCreate a variable named `sum` and assign it the sum of variables `empty` and `number`.\nCreate a variable named `typeOfSum` and assign it the type of variable `sum`.\n\nLet's provide an example that is fundamentally similar to what needs to be done,\nbut adapt it to the requirements of the task:\n```javascript\nconst money = null;\nconst extra = 1000;\nconst result = money + extra;\nconst type = typeof result;\n```",
