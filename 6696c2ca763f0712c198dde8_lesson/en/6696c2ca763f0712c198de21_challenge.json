  "name": "Unary plus - converting string to number",
  "instruction": "You saw an advertisement for a product in a store: \"Today the price is only 25 dollars!\". The price of the product was written on the price tag as a string.\nHowever, when paying at the cash register for the product, you need to know its numerical value.\n\nSet the variable `str` and assign it the value of the string `'25'`.\n\nSet the variable `price` and assign it the value of the string `str` converted to a number using the unary plus operation.\n\nHere is an example that is essentially similar to what needs to be done, but adapt it to the requirements of the task:\n```javascript\nconst s = '10';\nconst x = +s;\n```",
  "instructions": {},
  "hint": "```javascript\nconst str = '25';\nconst price = +str;\n```"
