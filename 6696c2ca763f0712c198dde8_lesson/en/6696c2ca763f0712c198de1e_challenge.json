  "instruction": "It turns out that if you put a `+` sign before null, then \"nothing\" becomes the number 0!\n\nSet the variable `zero` and assign it the value `null`.\n\nSet the variable `value` and assign it the value of the variable `zero`, converted to a number using the unary plus operation.\n\nLet's give an example that is fundamentally similar to what needs to be done, but adapt it to the requirements of the task:\n```javascript\nconst s = null;\nconst x = +s; // 0\n```",
