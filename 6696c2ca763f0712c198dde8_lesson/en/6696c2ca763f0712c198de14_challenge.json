  "name": "Find the hypotenuse of a right triangle",
  "instruction": "In a right triangle, two legs `a` and `b` are given. Find the hypotenuse `c`.\n\nAssign a variable `a` and give it a value of an arbitrary non-negative number (the first leg).\n\nAssign a variable `b` and give it a value of an arbitrary non-negative number (the second leg).\n\nAssign a variable `c` in which you calculate the hypotenuse (the square root of the sum of the squares of the legs).\n\nHere is an example that is fundamentally similar to what needs to be done, but adapt it to the task requirements:\n```javascript\nconst x = 3;\nconst y = 5;\nconst z = (x ** 2 + y ** 2) ** 0.5 ;\n```",
