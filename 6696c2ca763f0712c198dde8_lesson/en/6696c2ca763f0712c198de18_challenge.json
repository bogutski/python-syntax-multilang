  "name": "Reduced by a factor of 10",
  "instruction": "Denomination is the change in the nominal value of money. It is usually expressed by \"trimming\" a certain number of zeros from old banknotes and issuing new money of a lower denomination.\n\nLet's assume that a denomination has occurred in a certain country, and one zero has been removed from the banknotes. Set the variable `money` and assign it a value of 1000. Then write the command to reduce the value of the variable `money` by 10 times.\n\nHere is an example that is fundamentally similar to what needs to be done, but adapt it to the task requirements:\n```javascript\nlet number = 30;\nnumber /= 10;\n```",
