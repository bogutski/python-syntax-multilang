  "instruction": "Set the variable `p` and assign it the value of the perimeter of the rectangle (an arbitrary non-negative number).\n\nSet the variable `a` and assign it the value of the first side of the rectangle (an arbitrary non-negative number that is less than `p`).\n\nSet the variable `b`, in which you calculate the second side of the rectangle using the formula `b = p / 2 - a`.\n\nHere is an example that is fundamentally similar to what needs to be done, but adapt it to the requirements of the task:\n```javascript\nconst z = 10;\nconst x = 1;\nconst y = z / 2 - x ;\n```",
