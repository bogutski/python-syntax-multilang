  "name": "How much does Santa weigh?",
  "instruction": "Every year on Christmas, the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) tracks Santa Claus using its advanced surveillance technology, and then shares this important information in real-time using the NORAD Santa Tracker.\n\nBased on flight profile data collected over 50 years of radar and satellite monitoring, NORAD concludes that Santa is likely around 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighs about 260 pounds (before cookies).\nFind Santa's weight in kilograms, if 1 pound = 0.453592 kg.\n\nTo solve the problem:\n\nSet the variable `pound` and assign it the value 0.453592.\n\nSet the variable `weight` and assign it the value 260 (weight in pounds).\n\nSet the variable `weightKg`, in which you calculate Santa's weight in kilograms.\n\n(Note: 1 pound = 0.453592 kg)\n\nHere is an example that is fundamentally similar to what needs to be done, but adapt it to the task requirements:\n```javascript\nconst km = 1000;                // 1 km = 1000 m\nconst distInKm = 25;            // distance traveled in km\nconst distInMeters = distInKm * km; // distance in meters\n```",
