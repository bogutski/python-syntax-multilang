  "name": "How far the cars will travel, taking into account the wind",
  "instruction": "Write a function `distance` that takes three parameters:\n`mpg` - fuel consumption in miles per gallon,\n`tank` - number of gallons in the tank,\n`wind` - percentage of wind assistance. If the number is negative, the wind reduces the distance.\n\nIf `wind` is `10`, it means that the wind increases the distance by `10%`.\nIf `wind` equals `-10`, then it means that the wind decreases the distance by `10%`.\n\nIf `wind` is not specified, consider that `wind` is `-5`. This is the default setting.\n\nThe function should return the distance the car will travel including the wind.\n\n* Create a variable `car1Distance` and assign it the result of calling the `distance` function with arguments `20`, `3` and `0`.\n* Create a variable `car2Distance` and assign it the result of a call to the function `distance` with arguments `30`, `3` and `10`.\n* Create a variable `car3Distance` and assign it the result of a call to the function `distance` with arguments `40`, `3` and `10`.\n* Create a variable `car4Distance` and assign it the result of a call to the function `distance` with arguments `50`, `4`.\n\n\nUse the formula `mpg * tank * (1 + wind / 100)` to calculate the distance."
