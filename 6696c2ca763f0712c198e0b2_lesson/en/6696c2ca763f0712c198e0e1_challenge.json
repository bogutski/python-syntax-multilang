  "name": "Weight of a box of coins",
  "instruction": "There are coins in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 25 cents.\n\nCreate variables that will determine the weight of each coin in grams.\n```javascript\ncent1 = 2.5\ncent5 = 5\ncent10 = 2\ncent25 = 5.67\n```\n\nWrite a function `coinBox` that takes parameters:\n`cent1Count` - the number of 1 cent coins\n`cent5Count` - number of coins with a face value of 5 cents\n`cent10Count` - number of coins with face value of 10 cents\n`cent25Count` - number of 25 cents coins\n`boxWeight` - weight of box in kilograms.\n\nIf the box weight is not specified, it defaults to `0.5` kilograms.\n\nThe function should return the weight of the box of coins in pounds.\n\n453.6 grams = 1 pound\n\nUse the following algorithm in the function:\n```javascript.\nconst weight = cent1Count * cent1 + cent5Count * cent5 + cent10Count * cent10 + cent25Count * cent25 + boxWeight * 1000;\nconst totalWeight = weight / 453.6;\n```\n\n* Create a variable `alexCoinBox` and assign to it the result of a call to the function `coinBox(1, 2, 3, 4)`\n* Create a variable `bobCoinBox` and assign to it the result of a call to the function `coinBox(1, 2, 3, 4, 0.7)`\n* Create a variable `charlieCoinBox` and assign to it the result of a call to the function `coinBox(1, 2, 3, 4, 0.3)`"
