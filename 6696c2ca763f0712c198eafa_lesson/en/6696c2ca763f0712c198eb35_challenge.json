  "instruction": "The function `booksToRead` takes a non-empty array of objects `books` containing information about books and returns a string with the titles and authors of the books.\n\nEach object in the array has four properties/keys:\n* `title` - the title of the book, a string\n* `author` - the author of the book, a string\n* `alreadyRead` - whether the book has been read or not, a boolean value\n* `pages` - the number of pages, a number\n\nExample object from the `books` array:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  title: 'The Design of EveryDay Things',\n  author: 'Don Norman',\n  alreadyRead: false,\n  pages: 310\n}\n```\n\nThe function should select the books from the array that have not been read yet (`alreadyRead` is `false`) and return their titles and authors in the following format:\n`You still need to read: \"${title1}\" by ${author1}, \"${title2}\" by ${author2}, ..., \"${titleN}\" by ${authorN}.`\n\nIf all books have been read, the function should return the string: `Congrats! You've read all books.`\n\nExamples of function calls:\n\n```javascript\nbooksToRead([{title: 'The Design of EveryDay Things', author: 'Don Norman', alreadyRead: false, pages: 310},\n            {title: 'The Most Human Human', author: 'Brian Christian', alreadyRead: true, pages: 584},\n            {title: 'The Pragmatic Programmer', author: 'Andrew Hunt', alreadyRead: true, pages: 352}]);\n// 'You still need to read: \"The Design of EveryDay Things\" by Don Norman.'\n\nbooksToRead([{title: 'A Christmas Carol', author: 'Charles Dickens', alreadyRead: false, pages: 104},\n             {title: 'The Night Before Christmas', author: 'Scarlett Bailey', alreadyRead: false, pages: 120},\n              {title: 'The Snowman', author: 'Raymond Briggs', alreadyRead: false, pages: 32}]);\n// 'You still need to read: \"A Christmas Carol\" by Charles Dickens, \"The Night Before Christmas\" by Scarlett Bailey, \"The Snowman\" by Raymond Briggs.'\n\nbooksToRead([{title: 'Fahrenheit 451', author: 'Ray Bradbury', alreadyRead: true, pages: 249},\n              {title: 'The Great Gatsby', author: 'F. Scott Fitzgerald', alreadyRead: true, pages: 180},\n              {title: 'Jane Eyre', author: 'Charlotte Bronte', alreadyRead: true, pages: 288}]);\n// 'Congrats! You've read all books.'\n```\nFix the code of the `booksToRead` function so that it passes all the tests and understand how it works.",
