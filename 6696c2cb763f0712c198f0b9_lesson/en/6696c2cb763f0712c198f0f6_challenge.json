  "instruction": "Write a function 'findArrayWithNumbers' that takes an array of arrays.\n\nThe function should return a new array with two elements:\n\n* The first element - a string `'Array with numbers by index <index>'`, where `<index>` is the index of the array in the original array where the numbers were found.\n* The second element - an array consisting of the numbers that were found in the original array.\n\nBefore adding to the new array, each number should be multiplied by 3.\n\nExample: array `[['1','2','3'], ['test'], [7,8,9]]` should return array `['Array with numbers by index 2', [21,24,27]]`.\n\nAll internal arrays will consist only of strings and only one will consist of numbers.\n\nAn empty array will not be passed.\n\nSolution algorithm:\n* The first loop iterates over the outer array.\n* The second loop iterates over the inner array.\n* The `if` condition checks if the first element is not a number, then it breaks the loop.\n* In the `else` condition, we add the number multiplied by 3 to the new array.\n* Also, we need to save the index in a variable when we find which array contains the numbers.\n* At the end of the loop, we need to compose the string correctly and add the index to it.\n* Return the new array with the string and the array of numbers.\n\nExample function call:\n```javascript\nfindArrayWithNumbers([['1','2','3'], ['test'], [7,8,9]]); // ['Array with numbers by index 2', [21,24,27]]\nfindArrayWithNumbers([[20, 30, 40], ['a', 'b', 'c']]); // ['Array with numbers by index 0', [60, 90, 120]]\n```",
