1.  **jsbin.com** serves for practicing your programming skills.
2.  You need to leave two tabs open: JavaScript and Console.
3.  To set automatic line numbering, double-click the blank space to the right of JavaScript in the JavaScript tab.
4.  There are a number of ways to open the browser console:
* *1 way*: open the Main menu of Google Chrome browser: find the "three vertical dots" icon on the right side of the address bar and left-click on the icon. Select **More tools** - **Developer tools** (Ctrl + Shift + I).
* *2 way*: right-click anywhere on the page, select **Inspect** - open **Console** tab.
5.  The **console.log();** command is used to output the information to the console.
6.  To quickly type **console.log();** in jsbin.com, type `cl` and press `tab` on your keyboard.

10. The **File - Save snapshot** command is used to save and send the code.
11. Comments are very important when writing a program. They describe what's going on inside the program, so it's easy for a person looking at the source code to understand it. You can use a comment to explain a piece of code. A comment line is not a program command and is ignored during program execution. Also, if you want some lines of the program not to be executed, you can comment out these lines.
11. To comment out a program line, put **//** at the beginning of the line. 
12. To comment out several program lines, highlight those lines and press `ctrl + /` (for Windows) or command+/ (for Mac), or enclose those lines in ** /\* . \*/ **.

Example 1. Type the name of your city in the console.
```
console.log('Miami');
```
Example 2. Type your name, then comment out this line.
```
// console.log('Alice');
```
Example 3. Print a few lines of a poem.
```
// 1 way:
console.log('Let it snow!');
console.log('Let it snow!');
console.log('Let it snow!');

// 2nd way:
console.log('Let it snow!\nLet it snow!\nLet it snow!'); //\n is a line break character
```
