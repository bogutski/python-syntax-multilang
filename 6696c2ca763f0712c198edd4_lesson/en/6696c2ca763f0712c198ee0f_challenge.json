  "name": "Decipher the abbreviated street names",
  "instruction": "In postal addresses, abbreviated street names are often used for brevity. There is an official table for decoding these abbreviations. For example, here are some of them:\n\n* St. = Street\n* Rd. = Road\n* Ln. = Lane\n* Dr. = Drive\n* Cir. = Circle\n* Ave. = Avenue\n* Pl. = Place\n* Sq. = Square\n* Pkwy. = Parkway\n* Ct. = Court\n* Hwy. = Highway\n* Plz. = Plaza\n* Blvd. = Boulevard\n* Bch. = Beach\n* Aly. = Alley\n\nIn fact, the table is quite large, but for the purpose of this task, we will only use the 15 abbreviations listed above.\n\nYou need to write a function `decodeAddress` that takes a string with an abbreviated address and returns a string that includes the address with the full street name.\n\nThe words in the string are separated by spaces. In a loop, you need to extract words from the string and compare them with the values in the table. If the word is in the table, it should be replaced with the full name from the table; otherwise, it should be left unchanged. It is not known in advance in what order the words will appear in the string, so each word needs to be checked.\n\nIf you have forgotten the algorithm for extracting words from a string, review the lesson \"Extracting Numbers from a String\". The solution is not allowed to use string methods: `split`, `replace`, `indexOf`, `lastIndexOf`, `includes`.\n\nExamples:\n```javascript\ndecodeAddress('123 Main St.') // '123 Main Street'\ndecodeAddress('1001 1st Ave.') // '1001 1st Avenue'\ndecodeAddress('55 North Center Drive') // '55 North Center Drive'\ndecodeAddress('') // ''\n```\nTo store the table, we will create an object `decodeTable`, where the abbreviations will be the keys and the full names will be the values.\n```javascript\nconst decodeTable = {\n  'St.': 'Street',\n  'Rd.': 'Road',\n  'Ln.': 'Lane',\n  'Dr.': 'Drive',\n  'Cir.': 'Circle',\n  'Ave.': 'Avenue',\n  'Pl.': 'Place',\n  'Sq.': 'Square',\n  'Pkwy.': 'Parkway',\n  'Ct.': 'Court',\n  'Hwy.': 'Highway',\n  'Plz.': 'Plaza',\n  'Blvd.': 'Boulevard',\n  'Bch.': 'Beach',\n  'Aly.': 'Alley',\n}\n```",
