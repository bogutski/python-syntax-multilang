Find the length of the circumference.\n\nSet the variable `radius` and assign it a value of an arbitrary non-negative number (radius of the circle).\n\nSet the variable `pi` and assign it a value of 3.14 (approximate value of Pi).\n\nSet the variable `length`, in which you calculate the length of the circumference (circumference length is equal to 2 * Pi * radius).\n\nHere is an example that is fundamentally similar to what needs to be done, but adapt it to the task requirements:\n```javascript\nconst r = 10;\nconst pi = 3.14;\nconst l = 2 * pi * r;\n```",
