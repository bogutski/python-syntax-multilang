  "instruction": "Given the length of a circumference. Find the radius of this circumference.\n\nSet the variable `length` and assign it a value of an arbitrary non-negative number (the length of the circumference).\n\nSet the variable `pi` and assign it a value of 3.14 (an approximate value of Pi).\n\nSet the variable `radius`, in which you calculate the radius (to find the radius, divide the length of the circumference by 2 * Pi).\n\nHere is an example that is fundamentally similar to what needs to be done, but adapt it to the requirements of the task:\n```javascript\nconst l = 10;\nconst a = 3;\nconst r = l / (2 * a);\n\n```",
