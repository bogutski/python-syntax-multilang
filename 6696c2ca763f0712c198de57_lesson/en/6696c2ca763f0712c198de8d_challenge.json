How many students will be in each group?\n\nCreate a variable `students` and assign it a value of 32.\n\nCreate a variable `groups` and assign it a value of 4 (number of groups).\n\nCreate a variable `oneGroup` and return the result: how many students will be in each group?\n\nLet's provide an example that is essentially similar to what needs to be done, but adapt it to the task requirements\n\n```javascript\nconst participants = 90;\nconst oneTable = 10;\nconst tables = participants / oneTable;\n```",
