  "name": "A function and a problem about buses. Version 3",
  "instruction": "Two buses left the same point at the same time and are moving in perpendicular directions.\n\nPerpendicular directions means that if the first bus moves up, the second bus moves right.\nOr you could say that the first bus is going north and the second bus is going west.\n\nThe speed of the buses is different.\n\nCreate a function `busDistance` that takes three parameters: `bus1`, `bus2` and `time`.\n\nThe function should return the distance between the buses.\n\nThe `bus1` and `bus2` are numbers, the speed, in miles per hour, at which the buses move.\n\nThe `time` is a number, the time, in minutes, that has elapsed since the buses left.\n\nRequirements for writing the function:\n* Create a variable `distanceBus1` in the function and assign to it the calculation of the distance traveled by the first bus.\n* Create a variable `distanceBus2` in the function and assign to it the calculation of the distance traveled by the second bus.\n* Do the rest however you want.\n\nExamples:\n```javascript\nbusDistance(10, 10, 60) // 14.142135623730951\nbusDistance(10, 20, 60) // 22.360679774997898\nbusDistance(10, 20, 120) // 44.721359549995796)\n```\n\nThis will come in handy:\n1. Recall geometry and the Pythagoras theorem.\n2. Use the `**` operator for squaring.\n3. To extract a square root use the powers of `0.5\n\n```javascript\nconst a = 2;\nconst b = 3;\nconst c = (a ** 2 + b ** 2) ** 0.5;\n```"
