  "name": "A function and a problem about buses. Version 2",
  "instruction": "Two buses left the same point at the same time and are moving in opposite directions.\n\nThe speed of the buses is different.\n\nCreate a function `busDistance` that takes three parameters: `bus1`, `bus2` and `time`.\n\nThe function should return the distance between the buses.\n\nThe `bus1` and `bus2` are numbers, the speed, in miles per hour, at which the buses move.\n\nThe `time` is a number, the time, in minutes, that has elapsed since the buses left.\n\nExamples:\n```javascript.\nbusDistance(10, 10, 60) // 20\nbusDistance(10, 20, 60) // 30\nbusDistance(10, 20, 120) // 60"
