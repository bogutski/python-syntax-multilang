  "name": "The function in which we reassign the values of the variables",
  "instruction": "Create a function `swapWorkers` that takes two parameters: `name1` and `name2`.\n\nInside the function, create a variable `shift1` and assign it the value of the `name1` parameter. Use the keyword `let`.\n\nInside the function, create a variable `shift2` and assign it the value of the parameter `name2`. Use the keyword `let`.\n\nPrint the values of the variable `shift1` into the console\nPrint the values of the variable `shift2` into the console\n\nInside the function, reassign the value of the variable `shift1` to `name2` and the value of the variable `shift2` to `name1`.\n\nOutput to the console the value of the variable `shift1`.\nPrint the value of the variable `shift2` into the console\n\nDon't let this function return anything. There is no need to write `return`.\n\nA similar example:\n```javascript\nfunction swap(a, b) {\n  let c = a;\n  let d = b;\n  console.log(c);\n  console.log(d);\n  c = b;\n  d = a;\n  console.log(c);\n  console.log(d);\n}\n```\n\nIf you're looking for the point of this assignment, it's for you to learn how to do the assignment by instruction.\nThere is no practical point to this assignment, but it is good practice.\nIf all the tests pass, then you have done the assignment correctly.\n\nStick to the instructions and design style, or the assignment will not pass the tests.\n\nThere must be 8 lines of code inside the function."
