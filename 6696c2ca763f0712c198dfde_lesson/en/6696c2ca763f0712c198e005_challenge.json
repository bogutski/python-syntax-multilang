  "name": "Variables and functions. Room volume",
  "instruction": "You can create and use variables inside and outside functions.\n\nNow we are going to create a function that counts the volume of a room.\n\nThe height of the room is always the same - 10 feet, the width and length of the room will be different.\n\nCreate a function `roomVolume` with two parameters `width` and `length`.\n\nInside the function, create a variable `height` and give it a value of 10. Use the keyword `const`.\n\nInside the function, create a variable `volume` and assign it the value of the product of the variables `width`, `length` and `height`. Use the keyword `const`.\n\nReturn the value of the variable `volume` from the function.\n\nA similar example:\n```javascript\nfunction totalPrice(quantity, price) {\n  const tax = 1.08;\n  const total = quantity * price * tax;\n  return total;\n}\n```\n\nFollow the code formatting rules.\n\nIndentation, spaces, semicolons must be the same as in the example above."
