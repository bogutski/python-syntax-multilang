  "name": "The area of a circle, rectangle, and triangle",
  "instruction": "Let's write a universal function `getArea` that will calculate the area of ​​figures.\n\nThe function takes the following parameters:\n* `shape` - the name of the figure for which the area needs to be calculated. Allowed values: `circle`, `rectangle`, `triangle`.\n* `param1` - the first parameter required to calculate the area of ​​the figure. For a circle, it is the radius, for a rectangle, it is the length of a side, for a triangle, it is the length of the first side.\n* `param2` - the second parameter required to calculate the area of ​​the figure. For a circle, it is not used, for a rectangle, it is the length of a side, for a triangle, it is the length of the second side.\n* `param3` - the third parameter required to calculate the area of ​​the figure. For a circle, it is not used, for a rectangle, it is not used, for a triangle, it is the length of the third side.\n\nIf the first parameter is not equal to `circle`, `rectangle`, or `triangle`, then the function should return the string `Wrong Shape`.\n\nIf the first parameter is equal to `circle`, the function should return the area of ​​the circle, calculated using the formula `3.14 * (radius ** 2)`.\nIf the first parameter is equal to `rectangle`, the function should return the area of ​​the rectangle, calculated using the formula `side1 * side2`.\nIf the first parameter is equal to `triangle`, the function should return the area of ​​the triangle, calculated using the Heron's formula.\n\nKnowing the lengths of the three sides of a triangle, you can find the area of ​​the triangle using Heron's formula:\n\n```javascript\ns = (p * (p - a) * (p - b) * (p - c)) ** 0.5\n```\n\nwhere `p` is the semiperimeter of the triangle, equal to half the sum of the lengths of the three sides of the triangle, `a`, `b`, `c` - the lengths of the sides of the triangle.\nTo calculate the semiperimeter, add the lengths of the three sides of the triangle and divide by 2.\n\n* `** 0.5` - this is the square root.\n\nExamples of function calls:\n```javascript\ngetArea('circle', 5); // 78.5\ngetArea('rectangle', 5, 10); // 50\ngetArea('triangle', 6, 10, 15); // 20.123058912600737\n```",
