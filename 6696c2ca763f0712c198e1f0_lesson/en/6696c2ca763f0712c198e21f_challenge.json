  "instruction": "There are habits of putting off things and meetings for later.\n\nWrite a function `meetingProposal` that takes one argument `date` - the date of the meeting.\n\nIf `date` is 'today', the function should return the string 'Let's meet tomorrow'.\n\nIf `date` is 'tomorrow', the function should return the string 'Let's meet after tomorrow'.\n\nIf `date` is 'after tomorrow', the function must return the string 'Let's meet after after tomorrow'.\n\nIf `date` is not equal to 'today', 'tomorrow' or 'after tomorrow', the function must return the string 'Let's meet next week'.\n\n\nA similar comparison example:\n```javascript\nfunction compare(x) {\n  if (x === 10) {\n    return 11\n  } else if (x === 11) {\n    return 12\n  } else {\n    return 13\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou're probably wondering how to get an apostrophe (single quote) in a string? Like this:\n\n``javascript\nconsole.log('Let\\'s meet tomorrow');\n```\n\nUse a backslash `\\` before the apostrophe `'` and it won't count as the end of the line."
