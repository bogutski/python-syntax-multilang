  "name": "Area of the square",
  "instruction": "Given a side of the square a. Find its area s.\n\nDefine the variable `a` and assign to it the value of an arbitrary non-negative number (the side of the square).\n\nDefine a variable `square`, in which calculate the area of the square.\n\nHere is an example, which is fundamentally similar to what you need to do, but adapt it to the requirements of the problem:\n```\nconst x = 6;\nconst sq = x ** 2;\n```"
