To define a data type programmatically, the `typeof` operator is used.

Write `typeof` before the data whose type we want to know.

The console will display only the data type as a string.

```javascript
console.log(typeof 5) // number will be printed to the console

console.log(typeof 'Hello') // string will be printed to the console

console.log(typeof '3 + 3') // string will be printed to the console, as the mathematical expression is enclosed in quotes and it is a string
```

There are 8 data types, at this point you and I know 2 of them: `string` and `number`. We will study the other types later.
