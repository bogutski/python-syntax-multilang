So you add 1 to the number of chairs you have,\n and the result is 12.\n\nCreate a variable `count` and assign it the value 11.\n\nThen write a command that increases the value of the `count` variable by 1.\n\nHere is an example that is fundamentally similar to what you need to do,\nbut adapt it to the requirements of the task:\n```javascript\nlet a = 5;\na = a + 1;\n```",
