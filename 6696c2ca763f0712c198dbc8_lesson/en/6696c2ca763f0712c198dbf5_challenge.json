The population is increasing by 3% per year due to natural increase.\nWhat will be the population of the city one year from now?\n\nCreate a `people` variable and assign it the value 180000.\nThen write a command that increases the value of the `people` variable by 3%.\n\nHere is an example that is fundamentally similar to what you need to do,\nbut adapt it to the requirements of the task:\n```javascript\nlet a = 100;\na = a + a * 0.05; // the command increases the value of the variable `a` by 5 percent.\n```",
