  "name": "Weather. Is it warm or cold?",
  "instruction": "Write a function `currentWeather` that takes one parameter:\n* a `weather` object with weather information.\n\nThe `weather` object has two properties:\n* `temperature` - temperature in degrees Celsius, number,\n* `condition` - weather condition, empty string.\n\nThe function must change the `condition` property in the `weather` object as follows:\n\n* If the temperature is greater than or equal to 20 degrees Celsius, the weather condition should change to `warm`,\n* If the temperature is greater than or equal to 10 degrees Celsius and less than 20 degrees Celsius, the weather state should change to `cool`,\n* If the temperature is less than 10 degrees Celsius, the weather condition should change to `cold`.\n\nThe function must return the updated `weather` object.\n\nAn example of running the function:\n```javascript\ncurrentWeather({temperature: 10, condition: ''});\n// { temperature: 10, condition: 'cool' }\n\ncurrentWeather({temperature: 7, condition: ''});\n// { temperature: 7, condition: 'cold' }\n\ncurrentWeather({temperature: 25, condition: ''});\n// { temperature: 25, condition: 'warm' }\n```"
