  "name": "How much the car has fallen in price over the years",
  "instruction": "Write a function `changePrice` that takes parameters:\n* object `car` with information about the car,\n* a positive integer `year` - the current year,\n* a positive integer `n` - by how much the car became cheaper during the year.\n\nThe object `car` stores information about the car:\n* `make` - car brand, line,\n* `model` - car model, line,\n* `year` - the year of manufacture of the car, a number,\n* `color` - color of the car, line,\n* `price` - price of the car, number.\n\nEach year the price of the car decreases by `n` dollars.\n\n\nThe function should return a string like:\n'TOYOTA - CAMRY - 2020 - WHITE $60000'.\n\nAn example of running the function:\n```javascript\nchangePrice(\n{ make: 'Toyota', model: 'Camry', year: 2010, color: 'red', price: 20000 },\n2015,\n1500\n) // 'TOYOTA - CAMRY - 2010 - RED $12500'\n\nchangePrice(\n{ make: 'Ford', model: 'Mustang', year: 2015, color: 'white', price: 60000 },\n2016,\n2500\n) // 'FORD - MUSTANG - 2015 - WHITE $57500'\n```\n\nThe answer must be in upper case.\n\nIf current year is less than car year, the function should return a string like this: `Current year is less than car year`"
