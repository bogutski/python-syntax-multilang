  "name": "Calculate how many tiles you need to cover the room.",
  "instruction": "Write a `calculateTiles` function that takes three parameters:\n* `room` - an object describing a room,\n* `tile` - an object describing a tile,\n* `k` - coefficient that takes into account that tiles need to be bought by k percent more.\n\nThe `room` object has the following properties:\n* `width` - room width, number in inches,\n* `height` - room length, number in inches.\n\nThe `tile` object has the following properties:\n* `width` - tile width, number in inches\n* `height` - tile length, number in inches,\n* `quantity` - number of tiles, number 0.\n\nThe function should calculate how many tiles are needed to cover the room, taking into account the coefficient `k`.\n\nThe calculation result must be rounded up.\n\nTo calculate the number of tiles, use the formula:\n`number of tiles = Math.ceil((room area / tile area) * (1 + k / 100))`.\n\nThe function should return a `tile` object with the updated `quantity` property.\n\nFunction launch example:\n```javascript\ncalculateTiles({width: 100, height: 200}, {width: 2, height: 3, quantity: 0}, 10)\n// {width: 2, height: 3, quantity: 3667}\n```\n\nSimilar example:\n```javascript\ncalculatePaint({width: 25, height: 3}, {flowRate: 24, quantity: 0}, 15)\n// {flowRate: 24, quantity: 4}\n```"
