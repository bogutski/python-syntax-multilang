A very important process in learning to be a programmer, a tester, or any other
A very important process in learning to be a programmer, a tester, or any other "IT person" is practice, or more precisely, the practice of coding.


To learn how to program, you need to start practicing with small pieces of code, with the simplest programs and instructions, and then from that you can build something big, complex and most importantly - interesting!

We will begin our code-writing practice in the `sandbox` <https://play.localcoding.us/>, which is an online coding environment that allows us to write code directly in the browser without installing any software on the computer.

It's very simple: no extra buttons, ads, or anything else that might distract you.


But why not start writing code in an editor right away? Before we can master more complex tools, we need to master the basics, or in other words, figure out how to write simple programs. For this we will use the sandbox.


But how does the `sandbox` work? It's very simple.

As soon as you open the page, you will see the `Run` button on your screen, and above the button there is a line with the number `1`.

To work with the `sandbox` we will use the browser `Chrome` paired with a set of built-in browser tools - Developer tools (abbreviated as dev.tools).

Don't be frightened, I will now tell you how to open these tools and how to use them.

In the browser, in the upper right corner you will find three dots. Click on them and find the `More Tools` option.

At the very bottom of this option you will find `Developer tools`.

Also note that `dev.tools` can be opened with the key combination `Ctrl + Shift + I` (Windows) or `Cmd + Opt + I` (Mac).

`Dev.tools` can also be moved. 

Inside `dev.tools`, in the upper right corner, click on the three dots.

In the first option `Dock side` you will find options for the location of `dev.tools` in the browser.

Open `dev.tools` and go to the `Console` tab.

If you see any messages in the console - do not worry and just click on the `Clear Console` icon (the icon looks like a Stop sign).

You can also clear the console using the "hotkeys" - for Windows users this is `Ctrl + L`, and for Mac users this is `Cmd + K`.

Let's do what you've been waiting for - write our first team.

On the line, write

```javascript
console.log('Hello World!'); 
```

Click on the `Run` button and look at the result in the console.

Also, instead of `Hello World!` we can get the result of the addition.

In the line, write and run:

```javascript
console.log(3 + 4); 
```

The browser console will show the result of the addition.

Remember that there is no error highlighting in the `sandbox` code.

If you've made a mistake, you won't know it exists until
If you made a mistake, you won't know it exists until you click the `Run` button and look in the browser console.

If you have an error, read it carefully.
it in the console - there will be a hint, which is worth analyzing with your code.
