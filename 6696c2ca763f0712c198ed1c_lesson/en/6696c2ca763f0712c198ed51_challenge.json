  "name": "Count the number of words in brackets",
  "instruction": "Write a function `insideBrackets` that takes a string and returns the number of words inside the brackets.\n\nA closing parenthesis cannot be in front of an opening one.\n\nThere will always be `minimum one word` inside the brackets.\n\nSolution algorithm:\n\n* Use the `indexOf` method to find the first bracket and write it to the variable `firstBracket`.\n\n* Using the `indexOf` method find the first bracket and write it into the `secondBracket` variable.\n\n* Run a loop that starts from the `firstBracket` index and ends at the `secondBracket` index.\n\nAn example of running a function:\n```javascript\ninsideBrackets('one (two) three') // 1\ninsideBrackets('everything is fine') // 3\n```"
