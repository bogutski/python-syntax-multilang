  "instruction": "Create a variable named `str` and assign it a value of an arbitrary non-empty string.\nCreate a variable `firstSymbol` and assign it the value of the first character of the string.\nCreate a variable `lastSymbol` and assign it the value of the last character of the string.\n\nCreate a variable named `areTheSame` and assign it the result of comparing the first character of the string with the last character,\ni.e. the variable `areTheSame` will have the value `true` if the first character is equal to the last character, and `false` otherwise.\n\nHere is an example that is fundamentally similar to what needs to be done, but adapt it to the requirements of the task:\n```javascript\nconst name = 'Andrew';\nconst first = name[0];\nconst last = name[name.length - 1];\nconst comparison = first === last;\n```",
