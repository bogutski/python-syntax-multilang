  "name": "Strict equality of two numbers (===)",
  "instruction": "The strict equality operator `===` checks for equality without type coercion.\nIf `a` and `b` have the same values and types, then the result of `a === b` comparison is `true`.\n\nCreate variables named `a` and `b` and assign them values of arbitrary numbers.\nCreate a variable named `isAEqualsB` and assign it the result of strict equality between variables `a` and `b`.\nThe variable `isAEqualsB` should have the value `true` if `a === b`, and `false` otherwise.\n\nHere is an example that is fundamentally similar to what needs to be done,\nbut adapt it to the task requirements:\n```javascript\nconst x = 2;\nconst y = 6;\nconst comparison = x === y;\n```",

  "hint": "```javascript\nconst a = 18;\nconst b = 16;\nconst isAEqualsB = a === b;\n```"
