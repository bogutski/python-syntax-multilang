  "name": "Weather Forecast. Objects.",
  "instruction": "The `averageTemperature` function takes a `weather` object, which contains information about the weather in different seasons.\n\nThe object `weather` has the following structure:\n* `summer` - average temperature in summer period, number;\n* `autumn` - average temperature in autumn, number;\n* `winter` - average temperature in winter, number;\n* `spring` - average temperature in the spring period, number.\n\nBy mistake, the average winter temperature was written to the `summer` property, and the winter temperature to the summer one.\n\nThe error should be corrected by changing the values of summer and winter period.\n\nCalculate and add a new property `averageTemperature`.\n\nLet the function return the updated object.\n\nAn example of running the function:\n```javascript\naverageTemperature({summer: 0,\nautumn:10,\nwinter: 25\nspring:15})\n// { summer: 25, autumn: 10, winter: 0, spring: 15, averageTemperature: 12.5 }\n```"
