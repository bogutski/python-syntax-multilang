  "name": "Filling out a sample check. Objects",
  "instruction": "There is a sample receipt for a purchase at the store. But it varies depending on the amount of the purchase.\n\nWrite a function `receipt` that takes three parameters:\n* `template` - object containing information about the receipt\n* `amount` - purchase amount, number\n* `number` - check number, number\n\nThe function must return an object `template`, which has the following structure:\n* `purchaseAmount` - purchase amount equal to the `amount` parameter, number\n* `receiptNumber` - check number equal to the parameter `number`, number\n* `discount` - amount of discount - must be calculated\n* `finalAmount` - total amount of purchase, see conditions below, number\n\nIf the purchase amount `amount` is greater than or equal to `1000`, then the discount is `10%` of the purchase amount.\n\nIf the purchase amount is less than `1000`, then you must remove the `discount` property from the `template` object and instead\nAdd the `message` property with the value `Thank you for your purchase!\n\nThe `finalAmount` property must contain the total purchase amount.\n\nIf there is no discount then the total amount is equal to the purchase amount `purchaseAmount`.\n\nAn example of running the function:\n```javascript\nreceipt({purchaseAmount: 0, receiptNumber: 0}, 1000, 1);\n// {purchaseAmount: 1000, receiptNumber: 1, discount: 100, finalAmount: 900}\n\nreceipt({purchaseAmount: 0, receiptNumber: 0}, 100, 1);\n// {purchaseAmount: 100, receiptNumber: 1, message: 'Thank you for your purchase!', finalAmount: 100}\n```"
