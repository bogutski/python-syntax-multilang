  "name": "The sum of positive even and odd numbers. Deletion of object properties.",
  "instruction": "The function `numberSum` takes 5 parameters: `count`, `n1`, `n2`, `n3`, `n4`.\n\nThe parameters `n1`, `n2`, `n3`, `n4` are integers. They can be positive or negative.\n\nThe object `count` has the following structure:\n* `oddPositive` - the sum of odd positive numbers, has the original value\n* `evenPositive` - the sum of even positive numbers, has an initial value\n* `fractional` - number, sum of fractional numbers.\n\nIt is necessary to remove the `fractional` property from the `count` object.\n\nThen evaluate `n1`, `n2`, `n3`, `n4` .\n\nIf the value is even and positive, then add the number to the sum of `evenPositive` object `count`.\n\nIf the values are odd and positive, then add the number to the sum of `oddPositive` object `count`.\n\nNegative numbers do not count.\n\nThe function must return the `count` object.\n\nAn example of running the function:\n```javascript\nnumberSum({oddPositive: 2, evenPositive: 6, fractional: 0}, 1, 2, 3, 4)// {oddPositive: 6, evenPositive: 12}\n```"
