  "name": "A beggar near a hot dog vendor",
  "instruction": "Near the street hot dog vendor stands a beggar.\n\nHe asks customers to give him coins as change.\n\nOne third of all customers give him coins.\n\nIt is necessary to calculate the beggar's earnings for the month.\n\nWrite the function `monthCollected`.\n\nParameters:\n* `customers` - number of customers per day\n* `days` - number of days the vendor worked in the month\n* `hotDogPrice` - hot dog price\n\n* Earnings are possible only if the hot dog price contains a fractional part.\n* One person buys only one hot dog.\n* The customer only gives the vendor bills without coins.\n\n* If the hot dog price is $1.65, the customer gives $2 and receives $0.35 in change.\n* If the hot dog price is $1.25, the customer gives $2 and receives $0.75 in change.\n* If the hot dog price is $1.00, the customer gives $1 and receives no change.\n\nPerform the calculation algorithm according to the following pseudocode steps:\n```javascript\n// Calculate the number of hot dogs sold by the vendor in a month.\nDEALS = CUSTOMERS * DAYS\n\n// Calculate the number of customers who gave coins to the beggar as change.\nCUSTOMERS_WITH_COINS = RoundDown(DEALS / 3)\n\n// Calculate the beggar's earnings for one deal.\nONE_DEAL_PROFIT = RoundUp(HOT_DOG_PRICE) - HOT_DOG_PRICE\n\n// Calculate the beggar's earnings for the month.\nMONTH_COLLECTED = RoundDown(CUSTOMERS_WITH_COINS * ONE_DEAL_PROFIT)\n```\n\nPseudocode is not code, but a description of the algorithm in a free form without using a specific programming language.\n\n\nFunction execution examples:\n```javascript\nmonthCollected(70, 24, 1.15) // 476\nmonthCollected(100, 30, 1.65) // 350\nmonthCollected(100, 30, 1.25) // 750\nmonthCollected(100, 30, 1.00) // 0\n```",
