  "name": "Distance between two points on the coordinate plane",
  "instruction": "Write a function `distanceBetweenPoints` that takes parameters:\n* `point1` - object with the coordinates of the first point\n* `point2` - object with coordinates of the second point\n\nEach point object has the following structure:\n```js\n{\n  x: 5,\n  y: 10\n}\n```\n\nThe function should find the distance between the two points and return it.\n\nThe answer must be a number.\n\nAn example of a function call:\n```javascript\ndistanceBetweenPoints(\n{ x: 5, y: 10 },\n{ x: 10, y: 10 }\n); // 5\n\ndistanceBetweenPoints(\n{ x: 5, y: 10 },\n{ x: 10, y: 20 }\n); // 11.180339887498949\n```\n\nUse the formula for the distance between two points in the plane to solve the problem:\n\n`d = √((x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²)`\n\nExplanation of the formula:\n* Squared the difference of the coordinates on the `x` axis and take the square root of that number\n* Squared the difference in coordinates on the `y` axis and take the square root of that number\n* Add up the two resulting numbers\n* Take the square root of the resulting sum"
