  "name": "Which room is bigger?",
  "instruction": "Write a function `compareRooms` that takes two objects: `room1` and `room2`.\n\nEach object stores information about a room.\n\nEach object has two properties: `width` and `length`. These properties store the width and length of the room.\n\nFor example, an object `{width: 10, length: 20}` means a room 10 feet wide and 20 feet long.\n\nThe function should return a string that means which room is larger in area.\n\n* If the first room is bigger, the function should return the string `Room 1 is bigger.\n* If the second room is bigger, the function should return the string `Room 2 is bigger`.\n* If the rooms are equal in size, the function should return the string `Rooms are equal`.\n\nAn example of running the function:\n```javascript\ncompareRooms({width: 10, length: 20}, {width: 5, length: 10}) // Room 1 is bigger\ncompareRooms({width: 10, length: 20}, {width: 20, length: 20}) // Room 2 is bigger\ncompareRooms({width: 10, length: 20}, {width: 10, length: 20}) // Rooms are equal\n```"
