This programming language is used in various fields:

â€“ Web application development â€“ `Front-end`
â€“ Server application development â€“ `Back-end`
â€“ Testing automation `UI` and `API` â€“ `QA Automation`
â€“ Mobile application development - `Mobile Development`
â€“ Desktop application development - `Desktop Development`
â€“ Game Development `Game Development`
â€“ Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence â€“ `Machine Learning` and `AI`

### Who this course is designed for

We developed this course for those who want to learn how to program from scratch.

It is assumed that you have no programming experience.

If you already know a programming language, it will be easier for you to understand the course material.


### The goal of the course is to teach programming and prepare you for the interview

We will solve problems from simple to complex and get to the tasks that are encountered in job interviews.

The goal of the curriculum is to develop programming skills and logical thinking.

The entire course material is built from the simple to the complex. You can do it!



### How the course works

The course consists of consecutive lectures. 

The lecture includes a video, an outline with explanations and code examples, tasks and tests.

### Video

Revisit the video to get a better understanding of the material.

Some topics are worth revisiting several times to better understand.

### Synopsis

There are explanations and code examples in the outline.

Pay attention to the code examples, try running them and see what happens.

### Tasks

Every lecture has challenges.

If difficulties arise, you can see a hint.

After solving the problem, you can see the solution.

### Tests

There are tests in every lecture. 

Choose one or more correct answers.

You can take the test as many times as it takes to successfully complete it.

### If you need help

Every lecture has a button `ðŸ™‹ Need help? Ask a question`.

Send us your question and we will try to answer it as quickly as possible.


* During the lecture it is desirable to repeat the code shown on the screen, to pay attention to the code of errors that occur during the execution of programs.

After passing the test, you can see the mistakes you made, retake the test, you can read more information and retake the test to review the lecture again for a better understanding of the material and retake the test.
