  "instruction": "Real estate becomes more expensive closer to the city center.\n\nIn the very center of the city, the price is 300% higher than the real estate located 50 miles from the center. In other words, it is three times more expensive.\n\nWrite a function `realEstatePrice` that takes two parameters:\n* `distance` - the distance from the city center in miles\n* `price` - the base price of the real estate 50 miles from the center.\n\nThe function should return the price of the real estate depending on the distance from the city center.\n\nAlgorithm for calculating the price:\n\nSuppose `distance = 10` and `price = 1000`\n\nTo solve the problem, calculate the price of the real estate in the very center of the city: `centerPrice = price * 3 = 1000 * 3 = 3000`\n\nThen find out how much the real estate becomes cheaper for each mile from the city center: `pricePerMile = (centerPrice - price) / 50 = (3000 - 1000) / 50 = 40`\n\nThe value of `pricePerMile` is the price for each mile from the city center. In other words, for each mile from the city center, the real estate becomes cheaper by $40.\n\nNow calculate how much the real estate becomes cheaper from the city center: `pricePerDistance = pricePerMile * distance = 40 * 10 = 400`\n\nAnd finally, calculate the price of the real estate: `finalPrice = centerPrice - pricePerDistance = 3000 - 400 = 2600`\n\nIf the distance from the city center is more than 50 miles, the function should return the base price.\n\nFunction execution examples:\n```javascript\nrealEstatePrice(50, 1000); // 1000\nrealEstatePrice(25, 1000); // 1500\nrealEstatePrice(15, 1000); // 2000\nrealEstatePrice(0, 1000); // 3000\n```",
