  "instruction": "The `orderDelivery` function takes three parameters: object `delivery`, `isDelivery` and `meridiem`.\n\nThe `meridiem` is a string that can take the values `am` or `pm`.\n`isDelivery` - delivery flag, boolean value;\n\nThe object `delivery` has the following structure:\n* `address` - delivery address, string;\n* `date` - delivery date, string;\n* `time` - delivery time, string;\n\nIf the property `isDelivery` is `true`, then the function should return a string of the form: `Your order was delivered to New York on 01.01.2020 at 12:00 pm', where:\n* `New York` is the `address` property,\n* `01.01.2020` is the `date` property,\n* `12:00` is the `time` property,\n* `pm` is the value of `meridiem`.\n\nIf the `isDelivery` property is `false`, the function should return a string like: `Your order was picked up by courier at 8:00 am on 01.01.2020`, where:\n* `8:00 am` is the `time` property,\n* `am` is the value of `meridiem`,\n* `01.01.2020` is the `date` property.\n\nAn example of running the function:\n```javascript\norderDelivery({ orderNumber: 7987, address: 'New York', date: '01.01.2020', time: '12:00'}, 'true', 'pm' ); //\nYour order 7987 was delivered to New York on 01.01.2020 at 12:00 pm\n```"
