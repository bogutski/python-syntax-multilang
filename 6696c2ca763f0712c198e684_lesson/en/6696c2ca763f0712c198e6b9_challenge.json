  "name": "Online shopping. Checking the availability of money",
  "instruction": "Buying from an online store is easy to exceed the limit of money on your account.\n\nLet's evaluate the basket we've put together at the online store and see if we have enough money to buy.\n\nWrite a function `onlineOrder` that takes four parameters:\n* `product1` - an object containing information about the product\n* `product2` - object containing product information\n* `product3` - object containing product information\n* `moneyAmount` - number, the amount of money the buyer has\n\nEach object of the above has the following structure:\n* `name` - product name, string\n* `price` - price of the item, number\n* `quantity` - the amount of goods, a number.\n\nIf the buyer has enough money for all products, the function should return the string `You can buy all products: product1,\n product2 and product3`.\n\nWhere `product1`, `product2`, `product3` are the names of products the buyer is going to buy.\n\nIf there is not enough money for all products, the function should return the string `You don't have enough money for all products`\n\n\nAn example of running the function:\n```javascript\nonlineOrder({name: 'bread', price: 10, quantity: 2}, \n{name: 'milk', price: 20, quantity: 1},\n{name: 'cheese', price: 30, quantity: 1},\n100) // `You can buy all products: bread, milk and cheese`\n\nonlineOrder({name: 'socks', price: 40, quantity: 10},\n{name: 't-shirt', price: 700, quantity: 1},\n{name: 'pants', price: 1000, quantity: 1},\n500) // `You don't have enough money for all products`\n```"
