  "name": "Sell pizza in slices. Version 2. Interest",
  "instruction": "Write a function `pizzaSlicePercent` that takes parameters:\n\n`pizzaPrice` - the price of the pizza\n`numSlices` - number of slices the pizza is divided into\n`slicePrice` - the price of one slice of pizza\n\nUsually it is more profitable to sell slices, because the markup is higher.\n\nYou need to calculate how many percent more profitable to sell slices than to sell it whole.\n\nExamples:\n```javascript.\npizzaSlice(20, 8, 4) // 60\npizzaSlice(20, 8, 5) // 100\n```\n\nExplanation of the first example.\nWhen selling the whole pizza costs `20` and when selling it in slices it costs `32`. That is, the markup is `12`.\n`12` is `60%` of `20`.\n\nYou can calculate the percentages by the formula: `markup * 100 / price of pizza`.\nCalculation `(8 * 4 - 20) * 100 / 20 = 60`.\n\nExplanation of the second example.\nWhen selling the whole pizza costs `20` and when selling it in slices `40`. That is, the markup of `20`.\n`20` is `100%` of `20`.\nCalculation `(8 * 5 - 20) * 100 / 20 = 100`"
