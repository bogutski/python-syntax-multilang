  "name": "Determine how the arrays are arranged",
  "instruction": "Write a function `arrayOrder` that takes three parameters:\n* `arr1` - array of elements,\n* `arr2` - array of elements,\n* `arr3` - array of elements.\n\nThe function must compare the lengths of the arrays and return a string:\n* `Arrays are in ascending order` - if the length of the second array is greater than the length of the first array,\nand the length of the third array is longer than the second, i.e. the arrays are in ascending order,\n\n* `Arrays are in descending order` - if second array length is less than first array length,\nand the length of the third array is less than the length of the second one, i.e. the arrays are in descending order,\n\n* `Not sure` - if the lengths of the arrays do not match the conditions above.\n\nAn example of function start:\n```javascript\narrayOrder([5, 'e'], [111, 2, 34, 4], ['fgh', 2, 35, 4, '54', 0, null]);\n//'Arrays are in ascending order'\n```\n\nSimilar example with strings:\n```javascript\nfunction strOrder(str1, str2) {\nif (str2.length > str1.length) {\nreturn 'Strings are in up order';\n} else if (str2.length < str1.length) {\nreturn 'Strings are in down order';\n} else {\nreturn 'Not sure';\n}\n}\n```"
