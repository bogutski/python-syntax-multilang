  "instruction": "Write a 'compareArr' function that takes parameters:\n* `arr1` - array of elements\n* `arr2` - array of elements.\n\nThe function should determine the length of each array and return a string like:\n* `Array1 is longer and its length is `n`,\nif the length of the first array is longer than the second, `n` is the length of the first array,\n\n* `Array2 is longer and its length is `n`,\nif the length of the second array is longer than the first, `n` is the length of the second array,\n\n* `Arrays are equal` if the lengths of the arrays are equal`.\n\nAn example of running the function:\n```javascript\ncompareArr([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n// Array2 is longer and its length is 5\n```\n\nSimilar example:\n```javascript\ncompareStr(\"abc\", \"hello\")\n// String2 is longer and its length is 5\n\ncompareStr(\"name\", \"hi\")\n// String1 is longer and its length is 4\n\ncompareStr(\"123\", \"abc\")\n// Strings are equal\n```"
