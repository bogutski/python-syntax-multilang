  "name": "Split the chocolate bar",
  "instruction": "There is a bar of chocolate with size `n * m`. Calculate the minimum number of breaks to divide the bar into 1 * 1 pieces.\n\nDefine variables `m` and `n` and assign them values of arbitrary positive numbers.\nDefine variable `pieces` and assign to it the value of the expression for calculating the number of breaks `m * n - 1`.\n\nHere is an example that is fundamentally similar to what you need to do, but adapt it to the requirements of the problem:\n```\nconst a = 20;\nconst b = 5;\nconst sum = a * b - 1;\n```"
