  "name": "Assignment of a value reduced by 1 (prefix form)",
  "instruction": "Assign to the variable `x` the value -10, then write a command that assigns to the variable `y`\nvariable `x` decremented by 1 using the decrement command (prefix form).\n\n\nHere is an example that is fundamentally similar to what needs to be done, but adapt it to the requirements of the problem:\n```\nlet a = -20;\nlet b = --a;\n```"
