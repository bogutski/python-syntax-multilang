  "name": "Assignment of a value reduced by 1 (postfix form)",
  "instruction": "Assign a value of 3 to the variable `x`, then write a command that assigns to the variable `y`\nthe value of the variable `x`, decremented by 1 using the decrement command (postfix form).\n\n\nHere is an example that is fundamentally similar to what you need to do, but adapt it to the requirements of the problem:\n```\nlet a = 20;\nlet b = a--; // the value of variable b is 20,\n               // because the b variable is first assigned the previous value of the a variable, i.e. 20,\n               //and afterwards the value of the a variable is decreased by 1.\n               // after this command, the a variable is 19, the b variable is 20.\n\n```"
