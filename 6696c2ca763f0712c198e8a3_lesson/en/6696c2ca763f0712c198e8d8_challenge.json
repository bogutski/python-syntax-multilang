  "name": "Fill the array with integers divisible by 3 and raised to a power of m",
  "instruction": "Correct errors in the `fillArray` function code.\n\nThe function accepts two non-negative integers `n` and `m`.\n\n* `n` is the upper limit of the range\n\n* `m` - degree\n\nYou need to create an array and fill it with integers from the range from `0` to `n` inclusive.\n\nThe array should include only those numbers from the specified range that are multiples of three.\n\nBefore adding a number to the array it must be raised to the power of `m`.\n\nThe function should return the resulting array.\n\nA number is a multiple of 3 if the remainder of the division of that number by 3 is 0.\n\nExamples of running the function:\n\n```javascript\nfillArray(10, 1); //[0, 3, 6, 9];\nfillArray(20, 0); //[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1];\nfillArray(10, 2); // [0, 9, 36, 81]\nfillArray(8, 3); // [0, 27, 216]\n```"
