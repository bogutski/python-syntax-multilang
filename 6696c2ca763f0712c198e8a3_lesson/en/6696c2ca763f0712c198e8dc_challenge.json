  "name": "Geometric progression",
  "instruction": "A geometric progression is a sequence of numbers in which each successive number, starting with the second, is obtained from the previous one by multiplying it by a certain number `q' (called the `denominator of the progression').\n\nFor example, the sequence 2, 6, 18, 54, 162, ... is a geometric progression with first term 2 and denominator 3.\n\nThe value of `n`th term of the geometric progression is calculated by one of the formulas:\n\n`an = a1 * q^(n-1)`\n\nwhere `a1` is the first term of the progression and `q` the denominator or\n\n`an = an-1 * q`\n\nwhere `an-1` is the previous term of the progression and `q` the denominator.\n\nWrite a function `progressionMembers` that takes three arguments:\n\n* `firstMember` - the first member of the progression,\n* `denominator` - denominator of the progression\n* `n` - number of members of the progression\n\nThe function should return an array filled with the first `n` members of the geometric progression.\n\nExample of calculating the first 4 members of a progression with the first term 2 and the denominator 5:\n\n```javascript\nconst first = 2;\nconst denominator = 5;\nconst n = 4;\nfor (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\nconsole.log(first * denominator ** (i - 1));\n}\n// 2\n// 10\n// 50\n// 250\n```\n\nExamples of running a function:\n\n```javascript\nprogressionMembers(2, 3, 5); // [2, 6, 18, 54, 162]\nprogressionMembers(1, 2, 10); // [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512]\nprogressionMembers(0, 4, 3); // [0, 0, 0]\nprogressionMembers(5, 0, 6); // [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nprogressionMembers(1, 10, 0); // []\n```"
