  "name": "How many hours, minutes and seconds until Christmas?",
  "instruction": "It is known that there are a certain number of days (24-hour periods) left until Christmas.\n\nBut children are so eager to receive gifts that they count the hours, minutes, and sometimes even seconds until the holiday.\n\nWrite a sequence of commands that calculates the number of hours, minutes, and seconds in the given number of days.\n\nCreate a variable `days` and assign it a value of an arbitrary number from 1 to 364.\nCreate a variable `hours` and assign it an expression to find the number of hours.\nCreate a variable `minutes` and assign it an expression to find the number of minutes.\nCreate a variable `seconds` and assign it an expression to find the number of seconds.\n\nHere is an example that is fundamentally similar to what needs to be done, but adapt it to the task requirements:\n```javascript\nconst weeks = 3;\nconst days = weeks * 7;\n```",

  "hint": "```javascript\nconst days = 30;\nconst hours = days * 24;\nconst minutes = hours * 60;\nconst seconds = minutes * 60;\n```"
