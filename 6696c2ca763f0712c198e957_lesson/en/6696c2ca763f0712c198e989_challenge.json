  "name": "Interrupt filling of the array at number 20",
  "instruction": "Write a function `stopAtTwenty` that takes 3 parameters: an empty array, a start value and an end value.\n\nThe array will be filled with numbers from the initial value to the final value inclusive.\n\nThe start value is the number from which the array will start to be filled.\n\nThe final value is the number that ends the array.\n\nThe starting value will always be smaller than the ending value.\n\nIf number 20 appears in the array, the array should stop filling.\n\nThe function should return the filled array.\n\nAn example of running the function:\n```javascript\nstopAtTwenty([], 1, 30); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]\nstopAtTwenty([], -3, 25); // [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]\nstopAtTwenty([], 5, 19); // [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]\nstopAtTwenty([], 20, 30); // [20]\n```"
