  "name": "Cylinder volume calculation with special rounding",
  "instruction": "To calculate the volume of the cylinder we use the formula: `V = π * r^2 * h`, where `V` is the volume, `r` is the base radius, `h` is the height of the cylinder.\n\n`r^2` is `r` squared.\n\nWrite a function `cylinderVolume` that takes two arguments: `r` and `h` and returns the volume of the cylinder.\n\nUse `Math.PI` to get the number `π`.\n\nRound up the result according to the following rules:\n* if the fractional part of the number is less than or equal to 0.3, round it down;\n* if the fractional part of the number is greater than 0.3 and less than 0.7, then let the fractional part of the number be equal to 0.5;\n* If the fractional part of the number is greater than or equal to 0.7, round up.\n\nExamples of running a function:\n```javascript\ncylinderVolume(1, 1) // 3\ncylinderVolume(2, 1) // 12.50\ncylinderVolume(2, 2) // 25\ncylinderVolume(4, 2) // 100\n\n\n```",
