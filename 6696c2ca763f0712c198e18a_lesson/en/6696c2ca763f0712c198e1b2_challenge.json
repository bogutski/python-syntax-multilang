  "name": "Which car we will drive next",
  "instruction": "The function `whichCar` takes parameters:\n\n* `car1OwnerName` - the name of the owner of the first car\n* `car1TankVolume` - how many gallons of fuel is in the tank of the first car\n* `car1Mpg` - fuel consumption of the first car, how many miles it will go on one gallon of fuel\n\n* `car2OwnerName` - name of the owner of the second car\n* `car2TankVolume` - how many gallons of fuel are in the second car's tank\n* `car2Mpg` - fuel consumption of the second car, how many miles it will travel on one gallon of fuel\n\nLet the function return a string of the form: `Congratulations, Bob, you win! Your car drive 45 miles more than Alice's car.`\n\nIf the distance is the same, then we return a string like this: `Congratulations, Bob and Alice, you win! Your cars drive the same distance.`. In this case the name of the owner of the first car must be first.\n\n\nTo solve this problem, find the distance each car will drive and compare them.\n\nHint: Distance = tank volume * fuel consumption.\n\nWhen outputting a string, you can use:\n * double quotes outside and single quotes inside: `\"Bob's\"``.\n * escape sign:  `'Bob\\'s'`, in which case single quotes can be used inside the string."
