  "name": "Applying a discount to the purchase",
  "instruction": "The function `discountPrint` takes:\n\n`clientName` - customer name\n`pricePerBox` - price per box\n`boxCount` - number of boxes\n\nThe function should return a string in the following format:\n`Hello Albert. Boxes: 5. Price: 100. Subtotal: 500. Discount: 4%. Total: 480.`\n\nThe discount should be applied to the total purchase amount.\n\n- `0%` - if the amount is less than 100\n- `1%` - if the amount is between 100 and 250\n- `2%` - if the amount is between 250 and 350\n- `3%` - if the amount is between 350 and 450\n- `4%` - if the amount is greater than 450\n\nTo solve this task, follow the algorithm below:\n1. Calculate `subtotal` - the total purchase amount without discount by multiplying `pricePerBox` by `boxCount`\n2. Create a variable `discount` with an initial value of 0. `let discount = 0;`\n3. Calculate `discount` - the discount percentage using the conditional operator `if` and compare `subtotal` with different values\n\nComparison example:\n```javascript\nif (a < 10) discount = 5;\nelse if (a < 20) discount = 10;\nelse if (a < 30) discount = 15;\nelse discount = 20;\n\n// This syntax is allowed for single-line actions\n// It is the same as:\nif (a < 10) {\n  discount = 5;\n} else if (a < 20) {\n  discount = 10;\n} else if (a < 30) {\n  discount = 15;\n} else {\n  discount = 20;\n}\n\n```\n\n4. Calculate `total` - the total purchase amount with discount `subtotal - (subtotal * discount / 100)`\n5. Use concatenation to create a string in the format `Hello Albert. Boxes: 5. Price: 100. Subtotal: 500. Discount: 4%. Total: 480.` and return it from the function.",
