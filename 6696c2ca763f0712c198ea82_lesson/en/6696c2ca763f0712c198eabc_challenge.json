  "name": "The sum of even numbers of the array from the 5th to the 10th element inclusive",
  "instruction": "Write a function `from5ElTo10El` that takes one parametre - an array.\n\nThe array is of arbitrary length and consists of positive and negative integers.\n\nThe function should return the sum of even numbers from the 5th to the 10th element of the array inclusive.\n\nBefore executing the for loop, check the length of the array.\n\nIf the length of the array is less than 9, use the length of the array in the loop condition.\n\nIf the length of the array is greater than 9, use 9 in the loop condition.\n\nNote: remember that the numbering of array elements starts with 0.\n\nIf you want to get the 4th element of the array, its index will be 3.\n\nAn example of running the function:\n```javascript\nfrom5ElTo10El([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]) // 6 + 8 + 10 = 24\nfrom5ElTo10El([2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]) // 6 + 8 = 14\nfrom5ElTo10El([2, 40, 6, 80]) // 0\nfrom5ElTo10El([2, 4, 6, 8, -10, 12, 14, -16, 18, 20, 22, 24]) // (-10) + 12 + 14 + (-16) + 18 + 20 = 38\n```"
