  "name": "Creating a three-dimensional array",
  "instruction": "An array whose elements are other arrays is called a multidimensional (nested) array.\nThe most common multidimensional arrays are arrays with two levels of nesting - two-dimensional arrays.\nIf you nest another array in a two-dimensional array, you get a three-dimensional array, and so on.\n\nThe elements of a multidimensional array are accessed in the same way as the properties of nested objects.\nOnly instead of a point, square brackets are always used, and the element index is used instead of the property name.\n\nExample:\n```javascript\nconst array = [1, 2, [3, 4, 5, [6, 7, 8]]];\narray[1]; // 2\narray[2][0]; // 3\narray[2][3][1]; // 7\n```\n\nWrite a function `makeTripleArray` that takes three parameters:\n* `array1` - array;\n* `array2` - array;\n* `array3` - array.\n\nThe function should return an array with three levels of nesting, obtained as follows:\n* An array `array1` must be added to the end of the contents of the first array `array2`;\n* At the end of the contents of the second `array2` array, the `array3` array must be added;\n* The modified `array1` array is returned.\n\nAn example of execution of the function:\n```javascript\nmakeTripleArray([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]); // [1, 2, 3, [4, 5, 6, [7, 8, 9]]]\n```"
