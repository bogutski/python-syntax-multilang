  "name": "Convert the string and check if it is a palindrome",
  "instruction": "The `checkPalindrome` function takes the string `str`.\n\nThe string may contain spaces at the beginning and at the end, and may also contain uppercase letters.\n\nBefore checking if the string is a palindrome, the string must be converted to lower case and the spaces at the beginning and at the end must be removed.\n\nThe function returns a string that tells you whether the string is a palindrome or not:\n* if the string is a palindrome, the string `str is a palindrome` is returned\n* If the string is not a palindrome, the string `str is not a palindrome` is returned.\n\nwhere `str` is a string that was passed to the function but is already converted to lowercase and without spaces at the beginning and at the end.\n\nExamples of function start:\n```javascript\ncheckPalindrome(\"rePAPER \") // \"repaper is a palindrome\"\ncheckPalindrome(\"abac\") // \"abac is not a palindrome\"\n```"
